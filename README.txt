		How to Edit the Site
  
  INTRODUCTION
  ============
  
  This is a guide on how to edit your site. Some of the
  editing can be done directly in the Bluehost File
  Manager, while the rest must be done using other
  programs. Please be sure to follow the instructions
  carefully, or the site may cease to function properly.
  If you have any questions, please contact me at
  fzbreedon@gmail.com.
  
  To navigate to the File Manager, follow these steps:
  
    1)  Go to www.bluehost.com.
    2)  Login to your account.
    3)  Under "Advanced" click on "File Manager."
  
  To upload new or edited files onto your site:
    
    1)  In the File Manager, navigate to the folder
        that you want to add the files to. All the site
        files are located in "public_html."
    2)  In the top bar, click on "Upload". A new tab
        will open.
    3)  Drag and drop each file one by one that you want
        to add into the dotted box; or, click on the
        "Select File" button and choose the file you
        want to add.
    4)  If you are uploading an edited copy of a file
        already on the site, a warning window will pop
        up. Click on "Yes" to replace the old file with
        the new version. You can also check the
        "Overwrite existing files" box beforehand to
        skip this part.
        
  NOTE: I have had issues with the drag and drop system
        when uploading images. Make sure to add images
        one by one, not all at once. If the file or files
        fail to upload because they are too big, you will
        have to compress the files and upload the .zip
        file instead.
  
  EDTING
  ============
  
  You can edit and change the files on three of the
  site's pages: Paintings, Works on Paper, and Archive.
  
  The files for these pages are found in the "images"
  folder. They are named paintings, works on paper, and
  archive. Each folder contains an information folder,
  and paintings and works on paper have an icons folder as
  well. Works on paper also contains a "wide" folder for
  images larger horizontally than vertically. The archive
  images are divided into abstractions and landscapes.
  
  You can add a new file, or move, edit, or delete any of
  the files found in these folders.
  
  ADD    —  You can add an image by using the File Manager
            to upload the new image, as described above.
            Make sure that you are in the correct folder
            before clicking "Upload." Keep the file size
            under 2 MB, or it will affect the site's
            performance.
            
            You must also create an icon for the image you
            added. Open the image in an image editor and
            scale it down to 200 pixels. Name the icon the
            same name as the original image with "icon" at
            the end, and upload the new image to the
            "icons" folder in the same folder as the image
            you added earlier.
            
            You must finally also create an information
            text file for the image you added. On Mac,
            open the TextEdit application and create a new
            file. In the top menu, click on "Format" and
            select "Make Plain Text." Write the
            information for the image you uploaded in this
            file. The format for the information is:
          
                Name of the Piece
                Dimensions (height x width in)
                Medium
                Date
            
            Name the text file the same name as the
            original image with "info" at the end, and make
            sure it is a .txt file. Finally, upload the
            information file in the "info" folder in the
            same folder as the image.
  
  MOVE   —  The images appear on the site in the same order
            they appear in the File Manager. Bluehost sorts
            files alphabetically, so the only way to change
            the order is by adding a number to the begin-
            ning of each image file's name. To change the
            order, simply rename the image file to the
            numerical place you want it. Make sure to re-
            name all other files affected by the move.
            
            When you move an image, you must also move the
            image's icon and information to the same
            position in its folder. Otherwise, the site
            will show the incorrect icon or information for
            the images.
  
  EDIT   —  You can edit any image and icon as you like
            using your preffered image editing software.
            Generally, editing icons isn't necessary, as
            they are too small to see most changes. Once
            you have edited an image or text file to your
            liking, upload it to the site using the File
            Manager, and make sure to overwrite the old
            file.
  
  DELETE —  You can delete a file from the site using the
            File Manager. Find the file you want to delete
            and click it, then click on "Delete" in the top
            menu bar. Alternatively, you can right click
            the file and then click on "Delete" from there.
            Make sure to delete the image, icon, and info
            file for the same image.
  
  OTHER
  ============
  
  You can edit and change one other file on the site: your
  CV. The name of the file is "GW_cv.pdf," and is located
  in "public_html."
  
  You can replace this file with a new CV, as long as it is
  a PDF, and has the same name. Do not delete it, just
  overwrite it when you upload the new file.
