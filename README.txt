		How to Edit the Site
  
  INTRODUCTION
  ============
  
  This is a guide on how to edit your site. Some of the
  editing can be done directly in the Bluehost File
  Manager, while the rest must be done using other
  programs.
  
  To navigate to the File Manager, follow these steps:
  
    1)  Go to www.bluehost.com.
    2)  Login to your account.
    3)  Under "Advanced" click on "File Manager."
  
  To upload new or edited files onto your site:
    
    1)  In the File Manager, navigate to the folder
        that you want to add the files to. All the site
        files are located in "public_html."
    2)  In the top bar, click on "Upload". A new tab
        will open.
    3)  Drag and drop each file one by one that you want
        to add into the dotted box; or, click on the
        "Select File" button and choose the file you
        want to add.
    4)  If you are uploading an edited copy of a file
        already on the site, a warning window will pop
        up. Click on "Yes" to replace the old file with
        the new version. You can also check the
        "Overwrite existing files" box beforehand to
        skip this part.
        
  NOTE: I have had issues with the drag and drop system
        when uploading images. Make sure to add images
        one by one, not all at once. If the file or files
        fail to upload because they are too big, you will
        have to compress the files and upload the .zip
        file instead.
  
  IMAGES
  ============
  
  You can edit and change the images on three of the
  site's pages: Painting, Works on Paper, and Archive.
  
  The files for these pages are found in the "images"
  folder. They are named paintings, works on paper, and
  archive. The archive images are divided into
  abstractions and landscapes.
  
  You can add a new image, or move, edit, replace, or
  delete any of the images found in these folders.
  
  ADD  - You can add an image simply by dragging it or
         copying it into the appropriate image folder.
         Keep the file size under 2 MB, or it will
         affect the site's performance.
         
         You must also create an icon for the image you
         added. Open the image in an image editor and
         scale it down to 200 pixels. Name the icon the
         same name as the original image with "icon" at
         the end, and export the new image to the "icons"
         folder in the same folder as the original image.
         Make sure the icon is in the same position as
         it's image.
         
         You must finally also create an information text
         file for the image you added. Create a new text
         document in the appropriate info folder. Name the
         text file the same name as the original image
         with "info" at the end, and make sure it is a
         .txt file. The info file must be in the same
         position as the original image. The format for
         the information is:
         
             Name of the Piece
             Dimensions (height x width in)
             Medium
             Date
  
  MOVE    - The images appear in the gallery on the site in
            the same order as they appear in these folders.
            When you move an image, make sure to move the
            image's icon and information to the same
            position in its folder. Otherwise, the site
            will show the incorrect icon or information for
            the images.
  
  EDIT    - You can edit any image and icon as you like.
            Generally, you don't need to edit an icon to
            match the image if you change the lighting, as
            the icons are too small to see any small changes.
  
  REPLACE -
  
  OTHER
  ============
  
  You can edit and change one other file on the site:
  your CV. The name of the file is "GW_cv.pdf".
  
  You can replace this file with a new CV, as long as
  it is a PDF, and has the same name.
