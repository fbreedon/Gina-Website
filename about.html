        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>My current paintings and works on paper involve textures of multiple voices.
        Clearly defined graphical lines and stencils sit on the surface of a shallow space,
        in tension with a more ambiguous environment of naturalistic gestures, which
        fade in and out of focus like distant memories. The layering, and the contrast
        between stencilled and hand-drawn marks in a wide vocabulary of signs, make
        reference to the influence of Photoshop on contemporary visual culture. The
        removal of the hand in my recent series of process-driven mono-prints highlights
        this dichotomy.</p>
        <p>Recent travels abroad have influenced my work. Inspired by a stay in Singapore
        in 2015 where I taught at Yale-NUS College, I began to employ spray-painted
        stencils over my gestural brush marks, making use of everyday textured
        materials as well as Chinese New Year’s decorations from Singapore. In 2016
        while a visiting artist at the American Academy in Rome, I renewed my interest in
        Baroque ceiling paintings and incorporated their spatial complexity into my
        compositions. I began to empty out the center and vary the density of marks.</p>
        <p>My work has been featured in numerous exhibitions in the U.S. and abroad.
        Recent solo exhibitions include the Coombs Gallery at American University of
        Paris, France, Korn Gallery at Drew University, New Jersey, Prince Street
        Gallery in New York City, and the Mondavi Winery in Napa, CA. I have been
        awarded residencies at the American Academy in Rome, the Rockefeller
        Foundation’s Bellagio Center in Italy, the Djerassi Foundation in California, the
        Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, the International School of Painting in
        Montecastello di Vibio, Italy and Yosemite National Park. In 2017, I completed a
        multi-part public art commission Clearing for Burnett Miller Park in McKinley
        Village in Sacramento.</p>
        <p>I received my MFA at Columbia University, a certificate at the New York Studio
        School and a BA from Hamilton College. I am currently a Professor of Art at
        University of California Davis.</p>
